# Hotel_Network_Topology

## Hotel Network Infrastructure Design

This project outlines the comprehensive network setup for a three-floor hotel, ensuring efficient connectivity, departmental isolation via VLANs, inter-floor routing, wireless accessibility, and IP addressing through DHCP. The goal is to provide robust and scalable network services across all departments.

## Project Overview
- Location: 3-floor hotel
- Purpose: Design and implementation of a secure and scalable LAN/WAN network
- Technologies: VLAN, DHCP, OSPF, Serial WAN links, Wireless APs, Inter-VLAN routing

## Network Topology

### Floor-wise Department Breakdown

| Floor        | Departments                         |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| First Floor  | Reception, Store, Logistics         |

| Third Floor  | IT, Admin                           |

Each floor has:
- One Router
- One Switch
- Serial DCE connection between routers
- Departmental PCs and Printers
- Wireless Access Points per department

## Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- VLANs & Trunking
- DHCP
- OSPF Routing Protocol
